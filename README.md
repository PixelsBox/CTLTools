## About Certificate Transparency (CT)
_â€œCertificate Transparency is a system for publicly logging digital certificates. Domain owners can monitor Certificate Transparency logs to discover certificates for their domains. Certificate Transparency helps you detect authorized but undocumented certificates as well as unauthorized certificates that were issued due to a security compromise."_
